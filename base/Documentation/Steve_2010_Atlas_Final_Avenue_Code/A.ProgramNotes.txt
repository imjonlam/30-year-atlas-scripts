'  -finalized linear interpolation script
'    -this will linearly interpolate a product between 2 dates
'    -it contains some reasonable tweaks but it's more than
'     likely that products will need some patching 
'    -be sure to read the boilerplate on the MAIN script
'     to understand just what is taking place
'

'  -GL breakup (2 week) was missing the 0226 date in the 
'   script Manual.CreateFreezeupBreakupGrid
'  -fixed
'
'01-DEC-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -finally updating CIS.ALL.AddPredomToFtab to incorporate fast ice
'   typing information that is stored in the EGG_ATTR column
'
'05-NOV-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -finally fixed incorrect reporting of input / missing / substitute charts
'   in the cisstats_*.txt logfile
'
'03-NOV-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -logic for patching fast ice AFTER the product was created was not
'   good, instead, we patch each input grid BEFORE processing
'  -this still permits users to opt to not to patch the fast ice as well
'  -updated some code in the CIS.CUSTOM.STATS.Main as well.
'  -somewhat unrelated but noteworthy... we moved all the climate data
'   from \\cisarchive\climate to \\netapp2\climate today as well
'
'20-OCT-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -changed "Eastern Coast/Cote est" in number of observations to read
'   "East Coast/Cote est"
'  -updated Great Lakes land datasets (was very old and missing islands)
'  -verified once again the re-assignment of ratio code first-year and
'   very-thick lake ice, it's okay
'  -I updated an ancient script to create the freeze-up and break-up data
'   its a standalone and is named "Manual.CreateFreezeupBreakupGrid"
'
'10-AUG-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -frequency of old ice for EC was a trace to 10/10 in old
'   atlas but this is not accurate
'  -it's set to 1 to 10/10 now in CIS.STATS.Main (CUSTOM too)
'  -there is logic code in CIS.STATS.Main (CUSTOM too) to permit 
'   changing from 1 to 0.3 (trace) if you feel like changing it
'
'20-JUL-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -code where the input list of charts is created was not working
'   properly
'     -if 1 substitute chart was designated more than once, it 
'      would only be included once in the list
'     -code entirely re-written and pulled out into separate script
'      called "CIS.ALL.GetListOfChartsToProcess"
'     -CIS.ALL.ImportCov was also updated to accomodate these changes,
'        -all changes here are backward compatitble if an older script
'         tries to use it
'     -a little more robust and clear now that all that code is pulled
'      out of the CIS.STATS.Main / CIS.CUSTOM.Main scripts
'  -added some functionality to deal with mixes of ratio and egg code
'     -user will be prompted if less than 7% (2 of 30) are ratio code
'      based charts and asks how they would like to handle FY code 6
'     -similar functionality for GL very thick and thick lake ice
'     -added some logging info regarding this as well
'
'07-JUL-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -final cleanup 
'    DONE-update all map templates
'      DONE-remove copyright symbol
'      DONE-change new predom legend to 1ere instead premiere
'    DONE-update exportmaporlayout
'      -use alchemy and PS instead of BMP method
'    DONE-review all shapefile paths and ensure they use the
'     \bnd\ or \land\ or etc.
'    DONE-update attribute dictionary for predom legend
'    DONE-review all global variables since names changed over the years
'    DONE-no data area over Bay of Fundy
'    -fast ice adjusting using Lionel's info
'
'21-APR-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -begin adding new functionality
'    -DONE median of ice concentration when ice is present
'    -DONE average of ice concentration
'    -fast ice typing
'       -need to compile that script, MAIN, USERINPUT for both
'        normal and custom
'    -statistical minimum ice concentration???
'    -statistical maximum ice concentration???
'  -TO DO
'    -add conc threshold to median script
'    -see to do list for predom
'    -above products

'15-FEB-2010, Steve McCourt
'  -modified CIS.STATS.PredomWhenIcePresent to not group 
'   FY ice categories but to maintain thin, medium, thick
'  -this is for a custom CCG data request
'  -fixed problem when "L" instead of "L." was encountered
'   in CIS.ALL.AddPredomToFTab

'30-MAY-2008, Steve McCourt
'  -chagned historic date of 0604 to be used
'  -record in:
'  
'  \\cisarchive\climate\Climate_Program_Support\Tables\hist_date_lut.dbf
'  
'  was modified
