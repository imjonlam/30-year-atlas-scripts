'simple instructions...
'1. see if the extension "Manual Grid Editor (v3)" exists
'    -use it to patch what you need
'    -IMPORTANT: set the analysis extent to your grid prior to edits
'    -make changes, it's pretty basic and intuitive
'
'2. export the "modified grid" to a new location and add it 
'   as a theme
'
'3. then run this script from the view with your new grid theme
'   to re-create the VAT entries (note will not work for freeze /
'   break grids).
